Currently a fast way to reach a state where the program is usable is as follows:

1. Install Python 3, make sure that it is in your PATH environment variable.

2. Using pip, install dependencies: 
2.a pip install wxPython
2.b pip install reportlabl

3. From the directory where wxproute.py is located, run the program: python wxproute.py

Steps 2. and 3. can be completed from the command line on Windows, MacOS or Linux.
